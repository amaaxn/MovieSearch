# MovieSearch

A React-based Movie Search App that allows users to search for movies and view details such as titles, posters, and year of release. The app uses the OMDb API (http://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch movie data and displays the results in a clean and responsive layout.

## Features
- Search for movies by name.
- View movie titles, posters, and release years.
- Responsive UI with a dark theme.
- Clean and minimal design with smooth animations.
- Back button to return to the search page.

## Technologies Used
- React.js for the frontend.
- Axios for making API requests.
- OMDb API for fetching movie data.
- CSS for styling and animations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/amaaxn/MovieSearch.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd MovieSearch

3. Install the required dependencies:

   npm install

4. Run the development server:

   npm start

   The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## How It Works

1. **Search for Movies**: Enter a movie name in the search bar, and the app will fetch relevant movie details from the OMDb API.

2. **View Movie Details**: Each movie result displays the title, release year, and poster image.

3. **Back to Search**: You can click the "Back to Search" button to reset the search results and perform a new search.


## Future Enhancements
- Implement more detailed movie information (e.g., plot, actors, ratings).
- Add pagination to handle large search results.
- Improve UI/UX with additional features such as filtering or sorting results.
- Implement dark mode toggle.
